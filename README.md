# Data Analysis Project

A sample project demonstrating data analysis patterns using Jupyter notebooks in VS Code.

## Setup
1. Install the Jupyter extension in VS Code
2. Select a Python kernel when prompted
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially

## Project Structure
- `Untitled-1.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - AI coding assistant guidelines

## Key Features
- Synthetic data generation with realistic patterns
- Multi-panel visualizations
- Statistical summaries and correlations
- Best practices for reproducible data science

## Usage
Open the notebook and run cells in order. The notebook demonstrates:
1. Library imports with version checking
2. Synthetic dataset creation
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Multi-panel visualization dashboard
